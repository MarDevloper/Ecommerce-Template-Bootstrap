                                    govern your use of our site. To make these terms easier to read, the Site and our
                                    services and content are collectively called the "Services". By using this site, you
                                    agree to follow and be bound by the following rules below. If you do not agree to

                                    may be notified via email. It’s important that you review the Terms whenever we
                                    update them or you use the Services. If you continue to use the Services after we
                                    have posted updated Terms, you are agreeing to be bound by the updated Terms. If you
                                    don’t agree to be bound by the updated Terms, then you may not use the Services
                                    anymore. Because our Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue
                                    all or any part of the Services, at any time and without notice, at our sole
                                    discretion.</p>
